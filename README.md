# UniEvent-2 Project Setup

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- An emulator running in the background
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Open the Project Folder**

   Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and in the terminal, navigate to the project folder by running:

   ```bash
   cd UniEvent-2
   ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies**

   In the VS Code terminal, install the necessary packages by running:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. **Start the Project**

   To run the project, execute the following command in the VS Code terminal:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

This will start the Expo development server, and you should be able to view the project in the emulator.
